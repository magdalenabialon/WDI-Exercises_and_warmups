#Welcome, Adventurer!

You will achieve glory! You will build the greatnesses!

##Montsers

You will conjure monsters! They will spit and howl!

##Heroes

You will recruit heroes, to slash and plunder. Plundering is most heroic!

##Dungeons

Dungeons don't have forked passages! You just go through them!

#Step 1

Make the included specs pass

#Step 2

Write and implement specs for the following two features for greater justice!

##More Monsters!

We need Kobolds, Ratkin, Morbid Walkers

##More Heroes!

We need subclasses of Hero with different starting characteristics!

-Mage hits very hard and has very low toughness
-Berserker has armor, and takes 2 less damage on each counterattack
-Priest heals back to full health after every fight but is weak

##BONUS GLORY QUESTS!!

Experience and Leveling! Let our heroes level!
Skills! Let heroes aquire new methods they can use to attack! Bludgeonfist is not the only fist!
Loot! Let monsters drop useful stuff that affects stats!

##BONUS HEAVEN'S VICTORY QUESTS!!!!

Create a Dungeon class that stores a set of monsters to fight, and a victory message if you win!

Build a schema for storing heroes and monsters. You will need ActiveRecord polymorphisms,
read the docs and then ask for help! Update relevant rows when there is Battle!

##UNVERSE DUST OF MAGIC UNICORN FINAL FORM!!!!!!!!!

Build a Sinatra web page that lets users create a hero and enter battle with her until she dies,
and then, with great sadness and supportiveness, allow the user to move past her to a new hero,
until she dies as well.

Hint! You may want to make Dungeon belong_to user and Monster and Hero both belong_to dungeon
