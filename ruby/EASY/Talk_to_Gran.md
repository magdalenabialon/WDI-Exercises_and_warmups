# Quiz-3 Talk to Grandma
---

Granny's hard at hearing. 

If you talk to Granny normally, she'll reply "SPEAK UP SONNY JIM"

If you talk to her in ALL CAPS, she'll reply "NO, NOT SINCE 1945"

The year will be a random year between 1930 and 1950.

If you say "BYE" to her she'll reply "What's that honey, I didn't hear you.."

When you say "BYE" three times in a row, you'll be able to leave Grandma.

You should call your method with `Grandma.talk`, and it should loop until you leave your Grandma.
