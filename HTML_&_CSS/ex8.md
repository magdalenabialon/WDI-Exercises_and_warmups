####css selectors

- Find `ex_08/`
- This directory includes starter code
- Practice using various CSS selectors including tag, id, and class selectors
	- The styles you use are up to you
	- The point of this exercise is trying out different selectors
- For example, here is the first you'll see:

```html

	<h2>Type Selectors</h2>
	<p>Selects elements by sepecified tag name.</p>
	<!-- example -->
	<p>I'm a paragraph</p>

```


- To show an example of a 'type selector', you can add something like this to the `css/styles.css`


```css

	p { 
		font: 14px / 19px Arial, Verdana, Sans-serif; 
	}

```

- It demonstrates using a type selector, i.e. `p`
